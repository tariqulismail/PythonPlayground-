# PyTorch Image Classifier Use Case



### What is Image Classification? 

In image classification projects, we train our models to differentiate between several different categories. For instance, we can train our model to identify digits from handwritten images, identify the type of clothing such as shirt, coat, skirt etc., and differentiate between cats and dogs and malignant and benign tumours. We can do anything you can think of and gather data for the same.


# Where Can it be Used?

Image recognition has a broad set of futuristic applications.

We can use image classification for facial recognition for security purposes.
We can train a model to understand our handwriting by feeding it our handwritten samples along with their
typed counterparts. It may seem tedious, but if accomplished, we can copy-paste the answers to our online exams from the internet and make them appear handwritten.
Cameras at departmental stores and shopping malls can identify our faces and track our shopping every time we visit, which will help them give us a personalised shopping experience.

It can also help doctors detect cancer at early stages from a CT scan of the patient, which is normally done manually by expert doctors. Though this application is still in the research stage, remarkable results have been obtained in recent experiments giving a ray of hope for the future.
Numerous other tasks can be achieved by image classification. Every task which needs to differentiate between some categories and we have enough data available can be accomplished using it.
